## Tips

* Always try to learn names (especially when participants are visible, whether 
remotely or in-person)!  Signing on/showing up early gives a chance to chat with people, 
say hello, establish connections.  

## Notes and Assignments

A skeleton outline for each section lives in the `lecture-notes` directory.  
These can be used to pre-populate an etherpad in either the in-person or 
online training, for participants to supplement.  

Pre-formatted exercises and assignments are in the `assignments` folder.  There 
are two versions of the exercises for each topic.  The two-day version is usually 
a single exercise, with instructions to be pasted into the training etherpad.  
The eight-week version is pre-formatted html, to be pasted into whatever online 
platform is being used (see logistics notes below).  

## Logistics

This course has been taught as a multi-week online class,
as a two-day in-person class,
and as a two-day class in which the learners are together in groups
and the instructor participates remotely.

### Online Training

*   Meeting space: we have primarily used a voice/video system like
    Google Hangouts or BlueJeans in conjunction with an Etherpad.
*   Online platform for assignment submissions and discussion: There
    have been several incarnations of this training that used a
    WordPress blog, GitHub, and Piazza for managing assignment
    submission and discussion.

## In-Person Training

*   Breakout rooms: At several points in the training, the participants are divided
    into small groups and tasked with a certain activity.  Since the activities may
    involve audio recording, it is best if each group can have their own space
    for breakouts.
*   Recording devices: participants should try to bring some kind of
    recording device (like a smartphone or camera) for live teaching
    exercises.
